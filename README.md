The code is written in R and based mainly in the [**stagedtrees**](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v102i06) package available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stagedtrees) and on [github](https://github.com/gherardovarando/stagedtrees).


Additional needed package, all avialable from CRAN: 

- `bnlearn`
- `SID` 
- `ggplot2`
- `data.table`
- `plyr`
- `ncdf4`
- `pracma`
